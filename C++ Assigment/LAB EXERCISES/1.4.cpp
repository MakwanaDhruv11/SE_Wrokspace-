// 4. Setting Up Development Environment
// o Write a program that asks for two numbers and displays their sum. Ensure this is
// done after setting up the IDE (like Dev C++ or CodeBlocks).
// o Objective: Help students understand how to install, configure, and run programs in
// an IDE.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main()
{
    int n1, n2, sum;


    cout << "enter two num : ";
    cin >> n1 >> n2;


    sum = n1 + n2;


    cout << "sum : " << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}
